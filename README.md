# Musuem Project

A fun project for me because it's almost a year and half since I last worked on React. This was great for me to get back to javascript framework after working on Angular for so long.

Features to look out for

- Basic Search Feature (basically filters query to painting name)
- Basic Routing (clicking painting takes to detail)
- Infinite Scrolling (only show 9 until scrolling down...less elements in DOM unless needed)
- Saving data to localStorage so no unnecessary calls to get data after first load

Somethings I could of done if I had more time

- Utilize Redux
- Proptype validations
- Unit testing
- Other filters on painting (medium, size etc.)
